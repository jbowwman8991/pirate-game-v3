<!--
This 64x64 pixel game was created for the Lowrez Jam 2024.
The game is still a work in progress and players might experience some hiccups.
Start the game as a swashbuckling pirate ready to fight some skeletons! There is only one level and in this level the goal is to defeat 10 skeleton enemies.
Move your pirate player around using 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D'. Attack by pressing 'X' or clicking the left mouse button! 
Be careful to not take too much damage or you'll have to try again!
